This is the code for a wearable electronic GPS device. The function of the device is to lead the user to a desired destination without the need 
for an Internet connection. The audience/market for this device I had in mind were hikers and outdoorsmen, where cell service might be weak 
or nonexistent. The selling point of this device was that it weighed only a few ounces and could be sewn on an article of clothing
or easily carried in a bag. It can be run on an external battery.

In the code is the algorithm that leads a person back to his/her destination, taking advantage of four RGB neopixels with integrated drivers
oriented in a north, south, west, and east fashion.
